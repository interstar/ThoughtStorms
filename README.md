## Project ThoughtStorms

Project ThoughtStorms is an umbrella to pull together and refresh a number of things I've worked on over the last 14 or so years. 

It contains various code-bases / sub-projects that are related to running [ThoughtStorms wiki](http://thoughtstorms.info) for over a decade.

ThoughtStorms was started in 2003 by Phil Jones using UseMod wiki. By about 2008 it had gone into a bit of a decline. Partly because spamming had forced me to close it to public contributions. And partly because blogs and other software were getting more compelling. In 2012 I began this project to revive and reanimate ThoughtStorms by porting it to the [SmallestFederatedWiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki ) and it contained an SFW plugin for my own custom markup language and other useful conversion scripts.

In 2016 I had a change of heart and moved ThoughtStorms back to some new very simple, self-written wiki software. For more information see [Leaving the SFW](http://thoughtstorms.info/view/leavingthesfw) This project now contains the code-base for that wiki. And more conversion scripts.

I have also, in parallel been developing several other wiki-like information managers and other personal information management software such as [SdiDesk](http://code.google.com/p/sdidesk/). Project ThoughtStorms is also the place where I keep the SdiDesk to SFW script (which can be used to then port to the new wiki)

### My Motivation

* I want to update and refresh my personal wiki, ThoughtStorms. 

* I want to have a wiki with some of the features I prototyped in SdiDesk.

* I'm buried under piles of paper notebooks where I scribble my ideas. I need a personal wiki to copy those ideas into so I can throw the notebooks into the recycling.

* I have a couple of other services that would make more sense as features embeddable in wiki / dashboard like things.
