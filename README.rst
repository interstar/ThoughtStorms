Project ThoughtStorms
=====================

Project ThoughtStorms is an umbrella to pull together and refresh a number of things I've worked on over the last 10 or so years. It's focussed on Ward Cunningham's Smallest Federated Wiki ( https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki ) which looks increasingly exciting as the solution to problems that I've had; some of which I didn't even recognise until I saw SFW.

My Motivation
-------------

* I want to update and refresh my personal wiki, ThoughtStorms, which currently resides at http://www.nooranch.com/synaesmedia/wiki/wiki.cgi .

* I want to have a wiki with some of the features I prototyped in SdiDesk, a personal wiki-like notebook I wrote for Windows back in the mid-noughties.

Why Use Smallest Federated Wiki
-------------------------------

* SFW separates into minimal back-end server and a rich client running in the browser. That means I can host personal wikis on my local machine and public copies in the cloud, while the client can run on desktop and mobile devices.

* The client and one implementation of the server are written in CoffeeScript. A language I'm using and liking a lot.

* SFW supports different content-types which can have their own rendering and editing interfaces. And you can extend it with plugins that add new types. That's something I need in order to reproduce the things I did in SdiDesk and some further projects which have never been released.

* The drag-and-drop refactoring looks like it will be very useful to clean-up and reorganise ThoughtStorms.

* The emphasis on making "federation" easy solves dilemmas like : I'd like to keep some personal information privately in my local wiki but also use a public wiki as a publishing medium. Oh, and I'd like to access it in the cloud, from anywhere. In a sense it seems that SFW is bringing git-like distributed thinking to wiki. I can have a local
